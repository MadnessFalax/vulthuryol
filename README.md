# PLC
This repository is dedicated to Programming Languages and Compilers course at Technical University of Ostrava. Each laboratory exercise can be found in corresponding folder i.e. Laboratory 1 task solution can be found in lab1 folder. Multiple lab exercises were either expanding preceding laboratory or expanding final project, which means that they are found in preceding labs folder.

## Project
Project description can be found at http://behalek.cs.vsb.cz/wiki/index.php/PLC_Project. Project source files are located in lab7 folder. TL;DR the goal is an implementation of lightweight compiler of custom language using ANTLR technology (https://www.antlr.org/).

## Compiler
Programmes have been writen using Visual Studio 2022, thus MSVC 14.3 compiler has been used for debugging purposes.

## Input Files
Input .txt files are taken from snippets as seen on http://behalek.cs.vsb.cz/wiki/index.php/Programming_Languages_and_Compilers#Laboratories so they can be easily redirected when launching built programme.
